## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. **Project Initialization**

* **Launch UiPath Studio**: Open UiPath Studio on your system.
* **Create a New Process**:

  * Click on **"Process"** to start a new project.
  * Name your project, e.g., `WhatsAppInvitationSender`.
  * Provide a brief description, such as "Automates sending personalized WhatsApp invitations."
  * Choose a location to save your project.
  * Click **"Create"**.([UiPath Documentation][1])

### 2. **Designing the Workflow**

* **Set Up the Main Sequence**:

  * In the **Project** panel, open `Main.xaml`.
  * Drag a **Sequence** activity into the workspace.
  * Rename it to `WhatsAppInvitationProcess`.([UiPath Documentation][1])

* **Read Excel Data**:

  * Use the **Excel Application Scope** activity to open your `contacts.xlsx` file.
  * Within this scope, use the **Read Range** activity to read the contact data into a DataTable variable, e.g., `dtContacts`.

* **Iterate Through Contacts**:

  * Use a **For Each Row** activity to loop through `dtContacts`.
  * Inside the loop, extract the `Name` and `PhoneNumber` for each contact.

* **Open WhatsApp Web**:

  * Use the **Open Browser** activity to navigate to `https://web.whatsapp.com/`.
  * Ensure that the WhatsApp Web session is already authenticated.

* **Send Messages and Attachments**:

  * Within the browser scope, use **Type Into** activities to search for the contact using their phone number.
  * Use **Click** activities to select the contact from the search results.
  * Use another **Type Into** activity to enter the personalized message.
  * Use the **Attach Window** or **Click** activities to click on the attachment icon and upload the invitation image.
  * Use the **Send Hotkey** activity with the "Enter" key to send the message.

### 3. **Exception Handling and Logging**

* **Add Try-Catch Blocks**:

  * Wrap the message-sending sequence within a **Try-Catch** activity to handle any exceptions.
  * In the **Catch** block, use the **Log Message** activity to log errors for debugging purposes.

### 4. **Testing the Workflow**

* **Run the Workflow**:

  * Click on the **Run** button to execute the workflow.
  * Monitor the execution to ensure that messages are sent correctly to each contact.

* **Validate Outputs**:

  * Check WhatsApp Web to confirm that messages and attachments are delivered as expected.
